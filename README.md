# Prefix and Postfix Calculator

## Project Overview
This project implements a simple **Prefix and Postfix Calculator** that allows users to evaluate mathematical expressions written in **prefix** or **postfix** notation. The calculator supports the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

In **Prefix notation**, the operator comes before the operands (e.g., `+ 3 4`), and in **Postfix notation**, the operator comes after the operands (e.g., `3 4 +`). This calculator allows users to input expressions in either of these notations, and it will compute and display the result.

The goal of this project is to provide a web-based tool to evaluate such expressions, with a simple and user-friendly interface.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Enter an Expression**:
   - For **Prefix Notation**: Enter your expression with the operator first. For example: `+ 3 4`.
   - For **Postfix Notation**: Enter your expression with the operands first, followed by the operator. For example: `3 4 +`.

2. **Click the "evaluate" Button**: After entering your expression, click the "Calculate" button to evaluate the expression. The result will be displayed on the screen.

3. **Clear the Inputs**: Click the "Clear" button to reset the input field and clear any results.
